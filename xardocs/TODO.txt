INVITE A FRIEND ADD ON
**********************

FUNCTIONALITY 
==============

User Interface and functionality
-------------------------------
1. Click Invite A Friend Link
2. Displays form to invite a friend
3. Form captures friend's name, email, username of inviter and date
4. Generate a unique sign up code
5. Save friend's email, date invited, inviter username, invite id to db
6. a. Check to see if user is already a registered user (FR)
   b. Check to see if the user has opted out (FR)
   b. Send the invitation if ok


Invitee
--------
1. Receives the email
2. a. Clicks on the link to take them to the site
   b. Option to OPT out of any further invites (FR)
3. Module looks up the id and invitee email
4. If ID is not valid (used), it displays appropriate page and exits process
5. If valid ID, displays the Registration module registration form
6. Prepopulation of the registration form with the email address 
7. User registers as normal - can change email address during registration
as the invite id is not linked (config option?)
8. Hook from Recommend module allows update of the Friend's table 
 - with date of registration
 - voids the invite ID code in the table so it can't be reused
9. Normal registration process takes over

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
=====================
Ultimately this is the case of justification for itemtypes but we can implement them later.
Thought about using sitecontact, but this invitation functionality is better suited to Recommend, 
very specific. At some later date we could take advantage of the sitecontact apis but very 
specific invitaiton related code seems to be better positioned in Recommend.

TABLE REQUIREMENTS
==================
Columns include:
0. ID
1. xar_uid of person inviting
2. Username of person inviting
3. Friend's email
4. Date invited
5. Date joined - blank if not used
6. Username (eg can't rely on the email as being the same as the invite)
7. Unique invite ID - blank if used
8. User ID of the invitee if they joined

Index: username?

CONFIGURATION of MODULE
=======================
Configuration page to display:
1. Users invites per page - itemsperpage
2. Require invitee email only to be matched to invite? - matchemail
3. User Invitation option? (off by default) - useinvites
4. Save registration and invitation data? (on by default) - saveinvites

FUNCTIONS
=========
1. DONE: xarinit addition - upgrade for module with table and any modvars
   DONE: - xartables.php file
2. DONE: Dynamic data object overlay
3. Admin GUI, templates and api
    - GUI : View invites view.php plus admin-view.xd - not critical at this stage
    DONE - GUI : Update modifyconfig, updateconfig and admin-modifyconfig.xd
    DONE - API: Generate ID
    DONE - API: update menu links and the include tab file template
4. User GUI, templates and api
    DONE - API: Get an invite record - get.php
    - API: Getall invites with selection criteria (eg by user) - getall.php - not critical at this stage
    DONE - API: create invite record
    - API: add to the encode and decode short urls - Not critical
    DONE: - GUI: display invite - use same function, but configurable templates eg user-invite.xd 
    DONE: - GUI: user html and text templates for the invite/recommend function (main.php). There is no custom template currently.
    DONE: - GUI: change the existing send function to create the invite code, adn use custom override templates instead of generic mail template.
    DONE: - GUI: new template to redirect users who have invalid invite code
    
HOOKS
=====
DONE: New hook functions required to update the invite record once the user has registered
      NOTE: - this was not required. Instead a new set of code was added in the invite.php function
              so that entry to registration can only be achieved through this function.
              Appropriate code and template checks also created to stop users going direct to the registration function.

DONE: Create/Update hooks (no gui required) to 
    -  grab the uid of the new registered user
    -  update the uid to the recommend table
    -  void the id and add the registration date (at registration or validation? must be registration) 
       :at registration, we cannot guarantee that validation is always required on a site
 
 
NOT IN SPEC
===========
DONE: Put in appropriate code/template check for this for the time being.
    Users can go directly to the registration link if they know it. 
    There must be a way of preventing registration unless there is a valid icode.
