# XarigamiND Recommend Module

* The Recommend module allows visitors to your website a chance to 
send out recommendations or invitations to their friends. The module 
provides a form to allow visitors to recommend your site to others via email.
In addition there is a custom 'send to friend' tag that you can use in your 
article templates allowing visitors to send a recommendation for a specific 
article.

A special feature of the Recommend module is the ability to set up "Registration 
by Invitation". Recommend module is integrated with Xarigami Registration 
and allows you to prevent registration except by invitation or in addition 
to invitation.
